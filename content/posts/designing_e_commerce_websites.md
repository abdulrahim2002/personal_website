## Introduction


## Functional Requiremenets

1. search: The search functionality provides users with the ability to
   list all products that best match their query. We should also be able
   to tell weather we are able to deliver a product to the users
   location or not. For example, if a product cannot be shipped to the
   user, it should be communicated to the user.
2. cart: users should be able to add items into their cart.
3. wishlist: users should be able to add items to their wishlist.
4. checkout + payment
5. view orders: users should be able to track their active orders
