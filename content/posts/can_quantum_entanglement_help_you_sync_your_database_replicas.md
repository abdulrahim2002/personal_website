title: "Can quantum entanglement help you sync your database replicas?"
subtitle: "Replicating data across multiple locations (nodes/datacenters
etc.) is a common practice in modern applications that operate at scale.
However, with data replication, keeping multiple replicas in sync
becomes a challenge. In this post, lets look at a unique approach
originating in quantum mechanics that might help tackle this issue."
description: "Replicating data across multiple nodes/clusters/data
centres is a common approach among applications that need to support
scalability/fault tolerance/disaster managemenet. However, this approach
also introduces the problem of keeping the replicas in sync. Existing
methods use distributed consensus mechanisms to keep replicas in sync,
with the latest write. In this approach, we explore an approach based on
quantum mechanics that has the potential to revolutnize the field."

# Introduction

The figure below shows a simplified setup of client-server web
applications. The user would send requests to the backend. Then this
request goes through several components like load balancers, app
servers, caching servers etc. These components perform several functions
like request validation, communicating with database server to
manipulate data, responding back the the user etc. In the diagram below,
we've abstracted away all these details for simplification.  The app
servers and other components need to communicate with a database system
to manipulate user data and return appropriate response.

However, there are few problems with this design. Consider what happens,
if the machine running the database system collapses. The user's data
will be lost and there's no way we can recover it back. Also, consider
what would happen when there are much more users than the capacity of
the database server. In this case, the queries will become slow and
user's will experience higher latency.
