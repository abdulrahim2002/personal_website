title: "Can quantum entanglement help you sync your database replicas?"
subtitle: "Replicating data across multiple locations (nodes/datacenters
etc.) is a common practice in modern applications that operate at scale.
However, with data replication, keeping multiple replicas in sync
becomes a challenge. In this post, lets look at a unique approach
originating in quantum mechanics that might help tackle this issue."
description: "Replicating data across multiple nodes/clusters/data
centres is a common approach among applications that need to support
scalability/fault tolerance/disaster managemenet. However, this approach
also introduces the problem of keeping the replicas in sync. Existing
methods use distributed consensus mechanisms to keep replicas in sync,
with the latest write. In this approach, we explore an approach based on
quantum mechanics that has the potential to revolutnize the field."

# Introduction

The figure below shows a simplified setup of a client-server web
applications. The user would send requests to the backend. There are
several components like load balancers, app servers, caching servers
etc. involved in receiving, validating, responding to the user's
request. We have abstracted them in a black box for now.  These
components need communicate with a database system to manipulate user
data.
